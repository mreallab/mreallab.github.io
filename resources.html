                        <h4>Title: Image Captioning
                            <br> Speaker: Xu Yang, April 3 2019</h4>
                        <p>
                            <b>Abstract</b>: The target of image captioning is to generate a syntactically and
                            semantically correct sentence which can describe the main content of the given image.
                            Compared with early image captioners which are rules/templates based, the modern captioning
                            models have achieved striking advances by three key techniques, i.e., encoder-decoder based
                            pipeline, attention technique, and RL-based training objective. However, these image
                            captioners lack the ability of commonsense reasoning, which is one important inductivce bias
                            owned by humans. For exploiting such language inductive bias, Scene Graph Auto-Encoder
                            (SGAE) is proposed for generating more descriptive captions.

                            <br> Speaker: Yulei Niu, March 27 2019</h4>
                        <p>
                            <b>Abstract</b>: Visual dialog is a challenging vision-language task, which requires the
                            agent to answer multi-round questions about an image. It typically needs to address two
                            major problems: (1) How to answer visually-grounded questions, which is the core challenge
                            in visual question answering (VQA); (2) How to infer the co-reference between questions and
                            the dialog history. An example of visual co-reference is: pronouns (e.g., `they') in the
                            question (e.g., `Are they on or off?') are linked with nouns (e.g., `lamps') appearing in
                            the dialog history (e.g., `How many lamps are there?') and the object grounded in the image.
                            In this work, to resolve the visual co-reference for visual dialog, we propose a novel
                            attention mechanism called Recursive Visual Attention (RvA). Specifically, our dialog agent
                            browses the dialog history until the agent has sufficient confidence in the visual
                            co-reference resolution, and refines the visual attention recursively. The quantitative and
                            qualitative experimental results on the large-scale VisDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets
                            demonstrate that the proposed RvA not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, but
                            also achieves reasonable recursion and interpretable attention maps without additional
                            annotations.

                            <br> Speaker: Xinting Hu, March 13 2019</h4>
                        <p>
                            <b>Abstract</b>: Instance segmentation is a long-lasting problem in computer vision and a
                            basic component of many applications, such as autonomous driving. Current instance
                            segmentation methods based on deep neural networks can be categorized into two types,
                            depending on how the method approaches the problem by starting from either detection or
                            segmentation modules. In this presentation, I will give introduction of thses two kinds of
                            methods and futhur cover some ideas about panoptic segmentation.

                            <br> Speaker: Mitra, March 06 2019</h4>
                        <p>
                            <b>Abstract</b>: Visual relationships represent the visible and detectable various
                            interactions between each object pair. Also, reasoning those relationships- formalized as
                            Visual Relation Detection (VRD) task- can be fed into higher level tasks such as image
                            captioning, visual question answering, image-text matching, as the intermediate building
                            block.
                            Reviewing of the task’s challenges, available datasets, and some state-of-the-arts is the

                        <p>
                            <b>Abstract</b>: The appearance of AlexNet relight the popularity of deep learning, and many
                            tasks in computer vision had obtained significant improvements based on these basic CNN
                            architectures pretrained on ImageNet. However, even now in 2019, many researchers still only
                            familiar with the ResNet (the winner of 2015 ILSVRC challenges). In this presentation, I
                            will review some famous CNN architectures and analysis the philosophy of these designs, to
                            help design better CNN architecture in our own specific tasks.

                        <p>
                            <b>Abstract</b>: Visual Question Answering is an important step from low-level cognition
                            tasks, like visual recognition/detection, sentence analysis, towards general artificial
                            intelligence. Although current VQA system is still not perfect, it motivates the community
                            to think about how to build a bridge between visual information and textual information,
                            which are two most important source of information the human can absorb.

                            <br> Speaker: Jiaxin Shi, Jan 16 2019</h4>
                        <p>
                            <b>Abstract</b>: Visual reasoning aims to answer questions about complicated interactions
                            between
                            visual objects. Existing models can be divided into two categories: holistic approaches and
                            module approaches. I will introduce typical works of these two categories.

                        <p>
                            The code is implemented based on Ruotian Luo's implementation of image captioning in
                            https://github.com/ruotianluo/self-critical.pytorch. And we use the visual features provided
                            by paper Bottom-up and top-down attention for image captioning and visual question answering
                            in https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention. If you like this code, please
                            consider to cite their corresponding papers and my CVPR paper.

                            The code is implemented by pytorch. And we separate the visual question answering and scene
                            graph generation into two repositories in github. The VQA code is directly modified from the
                            project Cyanogenoid/vqa-counting. The SGG code is directly modified from the project
                            rowanz/neural-motifs. If you like this work, cite their corresponding papers and my CVPR
